    "section": "About",
    "text": "About\nIn 2025, the Los Angeles area experienced two massive fires perpetuated by stong Santa Ana winds and dry brush. Though on opposite sides of the county, the Eaton and Palisades fires burned almost in unison and primarily impacted Altadena near Pasadena and Palisades near Malibu. As a result, over 16,000 homes and businesses were destroyed and 31 lives were lost (stat from Los Angeles County). The fires lasted 24 days, however both communities are still rebuilding after the tragedy. This project visualizes the aftermath and burn scars of the Palisades and Eaton fires with satellite images and geospatial data.\n\nHighlights:\n\nWork with and visualize raster data using xarray and NetCDF datasets\nAnalyze false color images with satellite imagery by using different reflectance wavelengths\nVisualize raster and geographic data together to determine areas with fire scars\nExamine socioeconomic demographics of areas affected by the fires\n\n\n\nData\nThis notebook contains datasets with the perimeters of the Palisades and Eaton fires and reflectance satellite imagery of the Los Angeles area following the fires. The perimeter data comes from the ArcGIS hub and can be downloaded here. The other dataset is a NetDCF comes from the Microsof Planetary Computer data catalogue and was collected by the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center and can be downloaded from this shared Google Drive.\nSocioeconomic data was quatified by the Environmental Justice Index data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires swept across many communities resulting in extreme damage. Through false color imagery, we visualized the burn scars in relation to the known perimeters of the fires. The percentage of uninsured homes across the Eaton fires was much greater than the percent of homes in the Palisades fires, with some areas reaching 7% of uninsured homes. This sheds light on a larger issue with insurance companies. According to an interview with NPR, many insurance companies retroactively denied coverage to many homes that experienced fires, ulitmately impacting more people than represented through this analysis."

    "text": "Background\nRockfish (genus Sebastes) are an important commercial and recreational fishing target on the west coast. The early life stages of Rockfish are spent in the water column until they grow strong enough to swim to structure. With global ocean temperatures increasing, I aim to analyze how increases in water temperature during Pelagic Larval Duration (PLD) affects the abundance of new rockfish, or Young of Year (YOY). I will utilize timeseries data of YOY abundance collected at the Northern Channel Islands. During data collection, California experienced a marine heatwave often referred to as “The Blob” during 2014-2016. I will analyze the effects of temperature on YOY abundance from 2012 to 2019 in order to determine if the warmer waters during the Blob influenced abundance and give insight to how the population may change has global ocean temperatures increase due to climate change. Additionally, I will incorporate the impacts of upwelling, which supplies nutrients to YOY during the PLD."

The YOYs were collected using Standardized Monitoring Units for the Recruitment of Fishes (SMURFs) that were placed just off the coast of the Northern Channel Islands in an attempt to collect recruit fish as they swam to structure. Monitoring took place from 2000-2018, with collections occuring year round starting in 2012.\nNOAA data is used to quantify temperature with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) lag 30 days from time of collection to predict SST during PLD. Upwelling was quanitified using the Biological Effective Upwelling Transport Index (BEUTI) lag 30 days."

    "text": "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)\n Upwelling is the result of moving water, often bringing cold, nutrient rich water from the deep up to the surface. This impacts the SST, decreasing temperature during mass upwelling. Additionally, the nutrients supplied in upwelling have a direct impact on YOY development, providing necessary nutrients during the PLD. Temperature also impacts fish development in the PLD, with faster development occurring at warmer temperatures."

    "text": "Data Cleaning\nBefore I can start working on my statistical modelings, I need to do some cleaning and filtering to get the data ready to be analyzed. I first subset my data to include only my species of interest. I chose Copper, Kelp, Gopher, Grass, and Brown rockfish, because they have similar PLDs and are difficult to differentiate at a small size. I chose to look at data between 2012-2019 to include before, during, and after the Blob. I also narrowed the window of sampling by year to only include sampling during the months of recruitment to avoid a seasonal pattern from emerging. I chose to only look at the two most consistently sampled sites, which were located at Santa Cruz island.\n\n\nCode\nrecruits &lt;- left_join(smurf, smurf_sp)\n\n\nrecruits$Date &lt;- as.Date(paste(recruits$year, recruits$month, recruits$day, sep = \"/\"))\nocean$Date &lt;- as.Date(ocean$Date, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\nrecruit_ocean &lt;- left_join(recruits, ocean)\n  \n\nrf_yoy &lt;- recruit_ocean %&gt;% \n  filter(year &gt;= 2012  &\n        (month &gt;= 2 & month &lt;= 7)) %&gt;% \n  filter(str_detect(site_code, \"HAZ\")| # Filter data for on Pelican and Hazards sample sites\n            str_detect(site_code, \"PEL\")) %&gt;% \n  filter(classcode == \"KGBC\" | classcode == \"SCAR/SCAU\" | classcode == \"SATR\") %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(year, month, day, classcode, total_fish_collected, SST_D30, beuti_30)\n      \n  \n\n\nsummarized_yoy &lt;- rf_yoy %&gt;% \n  group_by(classcode, year) %&gt;% \n  summarise(count = sum(total_fish_collected))\n\n\nhighest_rf &lt;- recruits %&gt;% \n  filter(genus == \"Sebastes\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(classcode) %&gt;% \n  summarise(count = sum(total_fish_collected)) %&gt;% \n  filter(count &gt;= 1000)\n\nmost_yoy &lt;- highest_rf$classcode\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrf_yoy_av &lt;- rf_yoy %&gt;% \n  group_by(classcode, year) %&gt;% \n  summarise(av_fish = mean(total_fish_collected)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(rf_yoy_av, aes(year, av_fish)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = classcode)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2014, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2016, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"darkgreen\", \"brown4\", \"lightblue\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Annual total fish collected\",\n       title = \"Recruit Rockfish counts over time\",\n       color = \"Species\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red-dashed lines denote the beginning and end of the blob.

    "text": "Statistical analysis\n\nHurdle Model\nIn order to analyze this data, I selected a hurdle model because the data contains many 0’s. Hurdle models are a type of hierarchical model that first tests presence and absence (0 and 1) with a predictor variable, then tests abundance. The presence-absence model is written using a Binomial model: \\[FishPresence \\sim Binomial(1, p) \\]\n\\[logit(p) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 SST + \\beta_2 BEUTI\\] The abundance uses a Negative Binomial model: \\[YOYcount \\sim NegativeBinomial(\\mu, \\theta)\\] \\[log(\\mu) = \\beta_3 + \\beta_4 SST + \\beta_5 BEUTI\\]\nFor simplicity in understanding the model, I only selected temperature as predictor variable to simulate data and return my selected beta values. To begin simulating data, I need to generate x values based on the SST lag 30 days variable from the original data. From there I can use those temperatures and beta values I selected to run the binomial equation to find logit(p). I think take the inverse logit of those values to generate p which represents the probability of success. Using that probability, I simulated a success variable with rbinom() to generate 0’s and 1’s.\nSimilar to the binomial step, I chose new beta values for the equation and used the same generated temperature data. The output of the negative binomial equation gives log of mu, or the mean. By applying an exponential to that, the mean of the data is found, which is then used to simulate count data using rnbinom().\n\n\nCode\nB0 &lt;- 3\nB1 &lt;- -0.1\nB2 &lt;- 2\nB3 &lt;- 0.1\n\nnew_recruits &lt;- expand_grid(mean_sst = seq(min(rf_yoy$SST_D30, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                           max(rf_yoy$SST_D30, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                           length.out = 1000)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(logit_p = B0 + B1 * mean_sst,\n         p = exp(logit_p) / (1 + exp(logit_p)),\n         success = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = p),\n         log_mu = B2 + B3 * mean_sst,\n         mu = exp(log_mu),\n         count = rnbinom(n = 1000, size = 1.5, mu = mu),\n         actual_abu = success * count)\n\nsim_hurdle_model &lt;- hurdle(actual_abu ~ mean_sst,  # formula: response ~ resp\n                   data = new_recruits, # data remains unchanged\n                   zero.dist = \"binomial\",\n                   dist = \"negbin\"\n                   )\n\nmodelsummary(sim_hurdle_model)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                 \n                (1)\n              \n        \n        \n        \n                \n                  count_(Intercept)\n                  1.958\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.268)\n                \n                \n                  count_mean_sst\n                  0.105\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.019)\n                \n                \n                  zero_(Intercept)\n                  2.399\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.783)\n                \n                \n                  zero_mean_sst\n                  -0.064\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.055)\n                \n                \n                  Num.Obs.\n                  1000\n                \n                \n                  R2\n                  0.925\n                \n                \n                  R2 Adj.\n                  0.925\n                \n                \n                  AIC\n                  8115.0\n                \n                \n                  BIC\n                  8139.6\n                \n                \n                  RMSE\n                  25.64\n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\nI successfully simulated data, applied the hurdle model, and got my beta values back!"

intervals are visualized through the bootstrapped values. According to the predictions, at an SST of 11.5 degrees C, we 95% confident the mean count of YOY’s would fall between 25 and 175. On the higher end of the temperature range, around 16.5 degrees C, we are 95% confident the mean abundance of YOY’s would fall between 0 and 60. The narrowest CI occurs around 14 degrees C, where we are 95% confident the mean value falls between 20 and 45 YOY. Additionally, there appears to be a negative relationship between SST and rockfish YOY abundance, leading me to fail to reject my null hypothesis.\n\n\nCode\npred_grid2 &lt;- expand_grid(SST_D30 = seq(min(rf_yoy$SST_D30, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                           max(rf_yoy$SST_D30, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                           length.out = 1000))\n\n# reiterate through the boot 1000 times\nboot2 &lt;-  map_dfr(1:1000, \\(i) {\n  # sample with replacement\n  boot_sample &lt;- slice_sample(rf_yoy, n=432, replace = TRUE)\n  # run a beta regression on every single boot sample\n  boot_mod &lt;- hurdle(total_fish_collected ~ SST_D30, \n                            data = boot_sample,\n                            dist = \"negbin\",\n                            zero.dist = \"binomial\")\n    # predict the boots values (the outcomes are best fit lines)\n  mutate(pred_grid2,\n         count = predict(object = boot_mod,\n                          newdata = pred_grid2,\n                          type = \"response\"),\n         boot = i)\n})\n\n\nboot2 %&gt;% \n  summarise(count_lwr = quantile(count, 0.025),\n            count_upr = quantile(count, 0.975)) %&gt;% \n  kableExtra::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\ncount_lwr\ncount_upr\n\n\n\n\n10.3683\n84.02929\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntrue_hurdle_model2 &lt;- hurdle(total_fish_collected ~ SST_D30, \n                            data = rf_yoy,\n                            dist = \"negbin\",\n                            zero.dist = \"binomial\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\npred_hurdle_model2 &lt;- mutate(pred_grid2,\n                            count = predict(object = true_hurdle_model2,\n                                            newdata = pred_grid2,\n                                            type = \"response\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(boot2, aes(SST_D30, count)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.05) +\n  geom_line(data = pred_hurdle_model2, aes(SST_D30, count), color = \"navy\") +\n  labs(x = \"SST degrees C\",\n       y = \"Rockfish YOY abundance\",\n       title = \"Hurdle model prediction of YOY abundance\") +\n  theme_light()"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThere are some limitations to the map. While it does provide areas of suitable habitat, it does not factor in species natural habitat, as my results show that Washington has the most suitable habitat for Red Abalone but are not part of Red Abalone’s natural range. It should also be pointed out that these are a subtidal species, and the temperature data used was sea surface temperature. This means that the temperature data may not be representative of true habitat ranges for species, especially those that live at deeper depths."

Keeping it constant will create simplicity while interpreting the model predictions.

According to the predictions, at an SST of 11.5 degrees C, we 95% confident the mean count of YOY’s would fall between 25 and 175. On the higher end of the temperature range, around 16.5 degrees C, we are 95% confident the mean abundance of YOY’s would fall between 0 and 60. The narrowest CI occurs around 14 degrees C, where we are 95% confident the mean value falls between 20 and 45 YOY. Additionally, there appears to be a negative relationship between SST and rockfish YOY abundance, leading me to fail to reject my null hypothesis."
