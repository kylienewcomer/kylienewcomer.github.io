The U.S. imports between 70% and 85% of its seafood, with more than half of that comes from aquaculture1. By increasing production of aquaculture in the U.S., we can find economic benefit and meet growing seafood demands. It has the capability of producing more sustainable protein options than land-based meat2. A study by Gentry et al. mapped the potential for marine aquaculture globally based on multiple constraints, including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, and bottom depth. They found that global seafood demand could be met using less than 0.015% of the global ocean area3.\n\nIn this project, I aim to visualize suitable areas for aquaculture of Oysters and Red Abalone along the west coast. Additionally, I created a function that will produce a suitability map for any species with habitat depth and temperature ranges.\n\n## Data\n\n### Suitable growing conditions\n\nInformation for both Oysters and Red Abalone temperature and depth ranges come from SeaLifeBase4.\n\n### Sea Surface Temperature\n\nTo determine the average seat surface temperature across the west coast an average from 2008-2012 data was calculated. Rasters were created by NOAA using satellite data from Coral Reef Watch5.\n\n### Bathymetry\n\nDepth data comes from General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)6\n\n### Exclusive Economic Zones\n\nThe West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone data is maritime boundaries come marineregions.org7\n\n# Data Processing\n\n## Cleaning\n\nBecause I am working with geospatial data, there is a lot data wrangling and transforming that needs to be done. I have to ensure that the raster data is compatible to be stacked. This includes matching the projections, resolution and extent. Additionally, the non-raster data needs to transformed so it can be used with the temperature and depth rasters.\n\nFind suitable habitat Suitability was determined using depth and temperature ranges for species. These values were taken from the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Bathymetry rasters. This was done by assigning 0’s and 1’s to the original depth and temperature rasters based on suitable ranges.\n\n\n\n## Read in data\n\n\n\n## Process data\n\nAll temperature rasters from 2008 to 2012 are stacked. The mean of all temperature rasters is taken to determine the average sea surface temperature. The temperature is converted from Kelvins to degrees celsius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Find suitable locations\n\nIn order to determine suitable areas of habitat, reclassification matrices are created to assign 1's to areas within the suitable temperature and depth ranges for Oysters. Areas without suitable depth and temperature ranges get assigned a 0. The CRS, extent, and resolution of the reclassified depth raster are updated to match the reclassified temperature raster. The updated depth and temperature rasters are multiplied together to determine which areas are suitable in both temperature and depth requirements. Any cell with a 1 in both temperature and depth will remain 1, while any cell without suitable depth or temperature ranges, or both, will be 0.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Reclassify temperature data\nrcl_temp <- matrix(c(-Inf, 11, 0,\n         11, 30, 1,\n         30, Inf, 0),\n       ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\n\ntemp_reclass <- classify(mean_sst, rcl = rcl_temp)\n```\n:::\n\nTo determine the suitable habitat, the temperature and depth rasters of 0’s and 1’s are multiplied, resulting in 1’s only in cells that had a suitable depth and temperature range and 0’s in all other cells.\n\n\n\n\nNeed to update depth raster to match temperature raster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Mapping suitable habitat from multiplied rasters\nOnce the suitable habitat is found, it can be visualized to see the areas along the west coast.\n\n\n\n\n# Find suitable habitat in EEZ’s\nWhile I found the cells within the raster that have suitable habitat, raster data is in a cell by cell format, which does not give an actual size of suitable habitat. I want to see the bigger picture of these suitable cells and how that reflects in the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) on the coast. This can be done through combining the EEZ data with the suitability raster and calculating the number of suitable cells in each region. Once the amount of cells per region is quantified, I can calculate the total area of the suitable by finding the cell size in km^2 and multiplying that by the number of cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that there is a calculated area of suitable habitat for each region, I can visualize it. My results show that the Central California region, followed by Southern California is the most suitable for Oyster aquaculture.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Region </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Number of cells with suitable habitat </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Area of suitable habitat </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Central California </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 238 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3296.1331 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Southern California </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 211 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2922.2021 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Washington </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 162 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2243.5864 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Oregon </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 71 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 983.3002 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Northern California </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 11 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 152.3423 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Map suitable area by west coast EEZ's\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Create function\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naquaculture_zones <- function(species, min_depth, max_depth, min_temp, max_temp){\n  # Temp reclassification\n  rcl_temp <- matrix(c(-Inf, min_temp, 0,\n         min_temp, max_temp, 1,\n         max_temp, Inf, 0),\n       ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n    \n  temp_reclass <- classify(mean_sst, rcl = rcl_temp)\n  \n  # Depth reclassification\n  rcl_depth <- matrix(c(-Inf, min_depth, 0,\n         min_depth, max_depth, 1,\n         max_depth, Inf, 0),\n       ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n  depth_reclass <- classify(depth, rcl = rcl_depth)\n\n  # Adjust CRS to match\n  crs(depth_reclass) <- crs(temp_reclass)\n \n  # Match resolutions of rasters\n  depth_resample <- resample(depth_reclass, temp_reclass, method = \"near\")\n\n  # Match extents of depth and temp rasters\n  cropped_depth <- crop(depth_resample, temp_reclass)\n\n  # Create raster denoting suitable depth AND temperature ranges\n  ocean <- cropped_depth * temp_reclass\n  \n  # Change EEZ CRS\n  st_crs(eez) <- crs(ocean)\n  \n  # Mask ocean data outside of EEZ regions\n  ocean_mask <- mask(ocean, eez)\n\n  # Rasterize eez data based on ocean mask\n  eez_raster <- rasterize(eez, ocean_mask,\n                          field = \"rgn\")\n\n  # Add up number of suitable cells per region\n  suitable_cells <- zonal(ocean_mask, eez_raster, fun = \"sum\", na.rm = TRUE)\n\n  # Determine cell size\n  cell_area <- cellSize(ocean_mask, unit=\"km\")[1]\n\n  # Calulcate area of suiable habitat based on number of suitable cells and cell size\n  suitable_cell_area <- suitable_cells %>%\n    rename(cells = depth) %>%\n    mutate(cell_area = cell_area$area,\n          suitable_habitat = cells * cell_area) %>% \n    select(-cell_area)\n  \n  # Join EEZ regions and suitable area\n  suitable_habitat <- left_join(eez, suitable_cell_area, by = \"rgn\")\n  \n  # Create map\n  tm_shape(ocean) +                                      \n    tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(show = FALSE)) +\n    tm_shape(suitable_habitat) +\n    tm_polygons(fill = \"suitable_habitat\", \n                fill.scale = tm_scale(values =  \"viridis\"),\n                                    #breaks = c(0,200,1000,2500,3000, Inf)),\n                fill.legend = tm_legend(title  = \"Suitable habitat (sq km)\")) + \n    tm_text(text = \"rgn\",\n            col = \"white\",\n            size = 0.35,\n            xmod = 4,\n            ymod = 1,\n            bgcol = \"black\",\n            bgcol_alpha = 0.75)+\n    tm_grid(alpha = 0.5) +\n    tm_title(paste(\"Suitable Aquaculture Zones for\", species))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Use function for new species of interest\n\n![](images/halruf.jpeg)\n\nRed Abalone were previously a popular fishery across the west coast, however the fishery closed in 2018 due to declining populations. The only source of Red Abalone on the west coast is currently through aquaculture. Because this species was a popular fishery and still has demand across the west coast, utilizing aquaculture zones along the coast would increase supply for this sought after mollusk. The depth range for Red Abalone is 0-24m and the temperature range is 8-18 ºC.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naquaculture_zones(species = \"Red Abalone\", min_depth = -24, max_depth = 0, min_temp =  8, max_temp = 18)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n",
