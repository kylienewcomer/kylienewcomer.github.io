The U.S. imports between 70% and 85% of its seafood, with more than half of that comes from aquaculture[^1]. By increasing production of aquaculture in the U.S., we can find economic benefit and meet growing seafood demands. It has the capability of producing more sustainable protein options than land-based meat[^2]. A study by Gentry et al. mapped the potential for marine aquaculture globally based on multiple constraints, including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, and bottom depth. They found that global seafood demand could be met using less than 0.015% of the global ocean area[^3].\n\n[^1]: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2022). U.S. Aquaculture.

Additionally, I created a function that will produce a suitability map for any species with habitat depth and temperature ranges.\n\n## Data\n\n### Suitable growing conditions\n\nInformation for both Oysters and Red Abalone temperature and depth ranges come from SeaLifeBase[^4].\n\n[^4]: Palomares, M.L.D. and D.

Rasters were created by NOAA using satellite data from Coral Reef Watch[^5].\n\n[^5]: NOAA Coral Reef Watch. 2019, updated daily.

I have to ensure that the raster data is compatible to be stacked. This includes matching the projections, resolution and extent. Additionally, the non-raster data needs to transformed so it can be used with the temperature and depth rasters.\n\nFind suitable habitat Suitability was determined using depth and temperature ranges for species. These values were taken from the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Bathymetry rasters. This was done by assigning 0’s and 1’s to the original depth and temperature rasters based on suitable ranges.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Process data\n\nAll temperature rasters from 2008 to 2012 are stacked. The mean of all temperature rasters is taken to determine the average sea surface temperature. The temperature is converted from Kelvins to degrees celsius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Find suitable locations\n\nIn order to determine suitable areas of habitat, reclassification matrices are created to assign 1's to areas within the suitable temperature and depth ranges for Oysters. Areas without suitable depth and temperature ranges get assigned a 0. The CRS, extent, and resolution of the reclassified depth raster are updated to match the reclassified temperature raster. The updated depth and temperature rasters are multiplied together to determine which areas are suitable in both temperature and depth requirements. Any cell with a 1 in both temperature and depth will remain 1, while any cell without suitable depth or temperature ranges, or both, will be 0.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Reclassify temperature data\nrcl_temp <- matrix(c(-Inf, 11, 0,\n         11, 30, 1,\n         30, Inf, 0),\n       ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\n\ntemp_reclass <- classify(mean_sst, rcl = rcl_temp)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo determine the suitable habitat, the temperature and depth rasters of 0’s and 1’s are multiplied, resulting in 1’s only in cells that had a suitable depth and temperature range and 0’s in all other cells.\n\n\n\nNeed to update depth raster to match temperature raster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Mapping suitable habitat from multiplied rasters\n\nOnce the suitable habitat is found, it can be visualized to see the areas along the west coast.\n\n\n\n# Find suitable habitat in EEZ’s\n\nWhile I found the cells within the raster that have suitable habitat, raster data is in a cell by cell format, which does not give an actual size of suitable habitat. I want to see the bigger picture of these suitable cells and how that reflects in the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) on the coast. This can be done through combining the EEZ data with the suitability raster and calculating the number of suitable cells in each region. Once the amount of cells per region is quantified, I can calculate the total area of the suitable by finding the cell size in km\\^2 and multiplying that by the number of cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Region </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Number of cells with suitable habitat </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Area of suitable habitat </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Central California </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 238 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3296.1331 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Southern California </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 211 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2922.2021 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Washington </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 162 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2243.5864 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Oregon </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 71 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 983.3002 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Northern California </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 11 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 152.3423 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Map suitable area by west coast EEZ's\n\nNow that there is a calculated area of suitable habitat for each region, I can visualize it.

The only source of Red Abalone on the west coast is currently through aquaculture. Because this species was a popular fishery and still has demand across the west coast, utilizing aquaculture zones along the coast would increase supply for this sought after mollusk. The depth range for Red Abalone is 0-24m and the temperature range is 8-18 ºC.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naquaculture_zones(species = \"Red Abalone\", min_depth = -24, max_depth = 0, min_temp =  8, max_temp = 18)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are some limitations to the map. While it does provide areas of suitable habitat, it does not factor in species natural habitat, as my results show that Washington has the most suitable habitat for Red Abalone but are not part of Red Abalone’s natural range. It should also be pointed out that these are a subtidal species, and the temperature data used was sea surface temperature. This means that the temperature data may not be representative of true habitat ranges for species, especially those that live at deeper depths.\n",
